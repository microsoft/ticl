# ticl - Tabular In-Context Learning

This repository contains code for training and prediction of several models for tabular in-context learning, including MotherNet and GAMformer.
MotherNet is a hypernetwork foundational model (or conditional neural process) for tabular data classification that creates a small neural network.
GAMformer is a model trained to output an interpretable, additive model using in-context learning.

Both the architecture and the code in this repository is based on the [TabPFN](https://github.com/automl/TabPFN) by the [Freiburg AutoML group](https://www.automl.org/).

This is a research prototype, shared for research use, and not meant for real-world applications. Responsibility for using the models contained in this repository,
as well monitoring and assessing potential impact of the models lies with the user of the code.

## Installation

It's recommended to use conda to create an environment using the provided environment file:

```
conda create -f environment.yml
```

## Getting started

A simple usage of our sklearn interface is:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from ticl.prediction import MotherNetClassifier, EnsembleMeta

X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

# MotherNetClassifier encapsulates a single instantiation of the model.

classifier = MotherNetClassifier(device='cpu', model_path="path/to/model.pkl")

classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_eval, p_eval = classifier.predict(X_test, return_winning_probability=True)

print('Accuracy', accuracy_score(y_test, y_eval))

# Ensembling as described in the TabPFN paper an be performed using the EnsembleMeta wrapper
ensemble_classifier = EnsembleMeta(classifier)
# ...
```

### MotherNet Usage

MotherNet uses the same preprocessing as the TabPFN work it builds upon, but we found that using one-hot-encoding during inference improves accuracy.
Scaling of features is handled internally.

### Model Training
Full model training code is provided. Training ``MotherNet`` is possible with ``python fit_model.py mothernet``. A GPU ID can be specified with ``-g GPU_ID``. See the ``python fit_model.py mothernet -h`` and ``python fit_model.py -h`` for more options.
The results in the paper correspond to ``python fit_model.py mothernet -L 2``, though default values might change and no longer reflect the values in the paper.
Data-parallel Multi-GPU training is in principal supported using ``torchrun``.
By default, experiments are tracked using MLFlow if the ``MLFLOW_HOSTNAME`` environment variable is set. 

## Papers
This work is described in [MotherNet: A Foundational Hypernetwork for Tabular Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.08598).
Please cite that work when using this code. As this work rests on the TabPFN work, I would suggest you also cite their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01848),
which also provides more background on the methodology.
